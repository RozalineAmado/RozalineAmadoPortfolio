            <h2>About Rozaline</h2>

            <p> <b>I only know how to throw myself into things at 140%. I am like this with companies, with industries, with partners, and games. I absolutely refuse to water myself, nor my drink, down for anyone, and if they can't handle it then they usually do not end up sticking around for long. I try to live life in the moment through the lens of an opportunist that tries to have a conscience. I have refined tastes but still find myself at Taco Bell too much. The 3 bands I fill my ears with perpetually are Interpol, Muse, and Tool.</b> </p>

            <p><b>Evolving Skillset/Info:</b></p>
            
                <p><b>I have intermediate experience at JavaScript, and beginner at HTML/CSS, C++ (Unity/Unreal 5 ) , and minor experience in Linux as well (raspberry pi fun times).</b></p>

                <p> <b> Highschool Diploma from Harrison School of the Arts, Tier 1 Sommelier with CMS. </b> </p>

                <p><b>Some of my hobbies include: PC gaming, cooking (preferably with wine), drinking tea, playing guitar, and soldering circuit boards.</b></p>

            <p> <b> "In My Defense" is a podcast in which pasionate lovers of musicians/bands that have been deemed by societal norms to be "bad" or "trash" are given a chance to defend their artist's content and provide the logic and/or incite needed to peer through their lense breifly "Your opinion is wrong...and that is okay." </b> </p>

            <p><b>I was inspired (by Michel Reeves from youtube) to make a polite Roomba (linux, C++, HTML, CSS). with an infrared scanner that says “sorry for bumping into you” when it bumps into people or pets (or in reality any being with a temperature higher than room temperature). So a Raspberry pi will be velcroed to the underside of a roomba along with an arduino that is connected to an infrared scanner that detects A. if what the roomba hit was hotter or colder than current room Temp, and B if it was then to execute apology. Figure I would start with something relatively safe to start with robotics instead of going straight to the lawn mower Robot. </b></p>

            <h2> <b>Rozaline's Services </b> </h2>

            <p><b>If I am hired for a remote location I can provide programming solutions that are geared towards simplicity in the spirit of future teamwork (someone else is probably going to look at/mess with this someday), website building, robotics coding is a deep passion of mine that I wish to pursue.</b></p>

            <p><b>If I am hired for an office position, I can build/fix just about any computer/server you may require to save a quantum computer (I would be open to this, just have no experience). I am meticulous with cable management as well as obsessive about system temps. So you hire a coder and get a part time IT girl to boot, quite an asset if you ask me.</b></p>
