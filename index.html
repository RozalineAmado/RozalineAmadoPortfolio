            <h2>About Rozaline</h2>

            <p> <b>I only know how to throw myself into things at 140%. I am like this with companies, with industries, with partners, and games. I absolutely refuse to water myself nor my drink down for anyone, and if they can't handle it then they usually do not end up sticking around for long. I try to live life in the moment through the lens of an opportunist that tries to have a conscience. I have refined tastes but still find myself at taco bell too much. The 3 bands I fill my ears with perpetually are Interpol, Muse, and tool.</b> </p>

                <li><b>Highschool Diploma from Harrison School of the Arts, Tier 1 Sommelier with CMS.</b></li>

            <p> <b>I am working on 2D game with Cyberpunk pixelart Graphics, The website for the podcast “In my Defense”, and I was inspired by Michel Reeves to make a polite Roomba (linux, C++, HTML, CSS). with an infrared scanner that says “sorry for bumping into you” when it bumps into people or pets (or in reality any being with a temperature higher than room Temperature).</b> </p>

            <p><b>I was inspired (by Michel Reeves from youtube) to make a polite Roomba (linux, C++, HTML, CSS). with an infrared scanner that says “sorry for bumping into you” when it bumps into people or pets (or in reality any being with a temperature higher than room Temperature). So a Raspberry pi will be velcroed to the underside of a roomba along with an arduino that is connected to an infrared scanner that detects A. if what the roomba hit was hotter or colder than current room Temp, and B if it was then to execute apology. Figure I would start with something relatively safe to start with robotics instead of going straight to the lawn mower Robot. </b></p>

            <h2><b>Rozaline's Services</h2>

            <p><b>If I am hired for a remote location I can provide programming solutions that are geared towards simplicity in the spirit of future teamwork(someone else is probably going to look at/mess with this someday), website building, Robotics coding is a deep passion of mine that I wish to pursue.</b></p>

            <p><b>If I am hired for an office position, I can build/fix just about any computer/server you may require to save a quantum computer(I would be open to this, just have no experience). I am meticulous with cable management as well as obsessive about system temps. So you hire a coder and get a part time IT girl to boot, quite an asset if you ask me.</b></p>
